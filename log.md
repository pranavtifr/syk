## To Do Work
  * Diagonalize Coupled SYK Especially near Low Energies
    * ~~Solve the problem of Coupled q-bits to figure out how to couple different fermions~~
    * Start writing code for the Cluster
    * Read about Metropolis algorithm and more about sampling for the syk model 
  * SYK for Generic Q-Body Interactions
    * Haved a look at the analytical from of energy density
    * Figure out a way to take the Large q limit for systems with multiple q's
  * Try for the coupling

  * Try to do this in Dim 2 in kinetic perturbation upto second order

### 21/6/18
 * We understood how to do coupled fermionic systems
 * Implemented all possible combinations instead of all possible permutations when we sum the SYK hamiltonian
### 20/6/18
 * Decided to solve the problem of Coupled Qbits
 * Problem of Majorana Ferminons in 2-d crops up
 * The energy distributions lack any structure for N<=12. Need to find a better way if we are working on coupled
	SYK or other higher q models which force us to use lesser N
### 19/6/18
 * Implemented the Coupled SYK in the existing Code
### 18/6/18
 * Got the Problem of Coupled SYK from Gautham
